# Document 1: Summary & Meeting Outline

## 1. Introduction & Project Summary
- **Project Goal**: Bridge the gap between theoretical guarantees and real-world performance for certain classes of algorithms, starting with fair hierarchical clustering and potentially expanding to parallel graph algorithms or approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems.
- **Advisory Role**: Harper will provide insight on which algorithms are most promising to compare, and you will take the lead in building the empirical testing environment.

## 2. Objectives for the Meeting
1. **Revisit Project Scope**  
   - Confirm that the initial focus on fair hierarchical clustering is still valid.  
   - Discuss additional algorithmic domains to explore (parallel graph algorithms, approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems).  
   - Set boundaries on how broad the set of algorithms will be.

2. **Discuss Literature Review & Algorithm Selection**  
   - Ask Harper about key conference/journal papers or new developments in the field of fair clustering and parallel algorithms.  
   - Identify 2–3 algorithmic domains to dive deeper into for the next few weeks.

3. **Define Roles & Milestones**  
   - Outline your primary responsibilities: building the testing framework, running experiments, and analyzing results.  
   - Decide how often to share progress (e.g., biweekly updates, monthly written reports, or some combination thereof).  
   - Determine how Harper prefers to provide feedback (GitHub, email, Slack, etc.).

4. **Implementation Details & Resource Requirements**  
   - Clarify the programming language(s) to use for the low-level environment (C++, Rust, etc.).  
   - Discuss any existing libraries or frameworks that might expedite the benchmarking environment.  
   - Confirm availability of computational resources (servers, clusters, or cloud instances) for larger-scale testing.

5. **Timeline Planning**  
   - Identify initial short-term goals (e.g., set up a basic test harness in C++ by next week).  
   - Plan medium-term goals (e.g., run initial experiments on synthetic datasets in 2–4 weeks).  
   - Long-term timeline (e.g., iterating on results and writing up the empirical findings).

6. **Open Questions to Clarify**  
   - How does Harper typically manage collaboration and code reviews?  
   - Are there specific conferences or deadlines to keep in mind for publishing results?  
   - Are there any particular real-world datasets Harper recommends?

## 3. Meeting Outcome
- By the end of this meeting, you should have:
  - A refined list of target algorithms or algorithmic families to compare.  
  - A clear plan for constructing the empirical testing environment.  
  - A roadmap of the next steps (assignments, reading, coding tasks) for the upcoming weeks.


## Notes
1. Fair Heirarechal Clustering
   1. Relatively implementable

## Paper on Parallel 

### Independent Set (5.3)
    Set of verticies that aren't connected by an edge (a set of all disjoint verticies)
    maximal -> the set where you cannot add anything


### 5.4 with verticies instead of edges

### 1 vs 2-cycle


## implementation detail
1. look into memory profiling on flume / hadoop



### timeline for writing thesis
1. background / literature review --> document this as you go
2. look at example 

# Goals:
1. read section 5 of this paper
2. try to read section 1 & 2
3. look at harper's fair H clustering papers (skim)
4. figure out flume (low priority)
5. start looking at some thesis (high) (be ready to start writing background next time)
