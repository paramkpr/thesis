% Any line that starts with a percent symbol is a comment. 
% They won't show up in the document, and are useful for notes 
% to yourself and explaining commands. 
% Commenting also removes a line from the document; 
% very handy for troubleshooting problems. -BTS

% As far as I know, this follows the requirements laid out in 
% the 2002-2003 Senior Handbook. Ask a librarian to check the

% Acknowledgements (Acceptable American spelling) are optional
% So are Acknowledgments (proper English spelling)

	I want to thank a few people.

% The preface is optional
% To remove it, comment it out or delete it.
    \chapter*{Preface}
	This is an example of a thesis setup to use the reed thesis document class.
	
	

    \chapter*{List of Abbreviations}
		You can always change the way your abbreviations are formatted. Play around with it yourself, use tables, or come to CUS if you'd like to change the way it looks. You can also completely remove this chapter if you have no need for a list of abbreviations. Here is an example of what this could look like:

	\begin{table}[h]
	\centering % You could remove this to move table to the left
	\begin{tabular}{ll}
		\textbf{ABC}  	&  American Broadcasting Company \\
		\textbf{CBS}  	&  Columbia Broadcasting System\\
		\textbf{CDC}  	&  Center for Disease Control \\
		\textbf{CIA}  	&  Central Intelligence Agency\\
		\textbf{CLBR} 	&  Center for Life Beyond Reed\\
		\textbf{CUS}  	&  Computer User Services\\
		\textbf{FBI}  	&  Federal Bureau of Investigation\\
		\textbf{NBC}  	&  National Broadcasting Corporation\\
	\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	

    \tableofcontents
% if you want a list of tables, optional
    \listoftables
% if you want a list of figures, also optional
    \listoffigures

% The abstract is not required if you're writing a creative thesis (but aren't they all?)
% If your abstract is longer than a page, there may be a formatting issue.
    \chapter*{Abstract}
	The preface pretty much says it all.
	
	\chapter*{Dedication}
	You can have a dedication here if you wish.

  \mainmatter % here the regular arabic numbering starts
  \pagestyle{fancyplain} % turns page numbering back on

%The \introduction command is provided as a convenience.
%if you want special chapter formatting, you'll probably want to avoid using it altogether

    \chapter*{Introduction}
         \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}
	\chaptermark{Introduction}
	\markboth{Introduction}{Introduction}
	% The three lines above are to make sure that the headers are right, that the intro gets included in the table of contents, and that it doesn't get numbered 1 so that chapter one is 1.

% Double spacing: if you want to double space, or one and a half 
% space, uncomment one of the following lines. You can go back to 
% single spacing with the \singlespacing command.
% \onehalfspacing
% \doublespacing
	
	Welcome to the \LaTeX\ thesis template. If you've never used \TeX\ or \LaTeX\ before, you'll have an initial learning period to go through, but the results of a nicely formatted thesis are worth it for more than the aesthetic benefit: markup like \LaTeX\ is more consistent than the output of a word processor, much less prone to corruption or crashing and the resulting file is smaller than a Word file. While you may have never had problems using Word in the past, your thesis is going to be about twice as large and complex as anything you've written before, taxing Word's capabilities. If you're still on the fence about  using \LaTeX, read the Introduction to LaTeX on the CUS site as well as skim the following template and give it a few weeks. Pretty soon all the markup gibberish will become second nature.

\section{Why use it?}
	
\LaTeX\ does a great job of formatting tables and paragraphs. Its line-breaking algorithm was the subject of a PhD.\thinspace thesis. It does a fine job of automatically inserting ligatures, and to top it all off it is the only way to typeset good-looking mathematics.

\section{Who should use it?}

Anyone who needs to use math, tables, a lot of figures, complex cross-references, IPA or who just cares about the final appearance of their document should use \LaTeX. At Reed, math majors are required to use it, most physics majors will want to use it, and many other science majors may want it also.
	
\chapter{Background}
	This is the first page of the first chapter. You may delete the contents of this chapter so you can add your own text; it's just here to show you some examples. 
	\section{Hierarchical Clustering and Cost}
	\subsection{Definition and Concepts}
		**Definition**: Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised learning method that produces a hierarchy of nested clusters organized in a tree structure (dendrogram). Formally, it can be represented as a binary tree $T$ whose leaves correspond to individual data points in dataset $X$ and whose internal nodes represent merged clusters containing those points. Each level of the tree yields a different partition of the data.

\chapter*{Conclusion}
         \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Conclusion}
	\chaptermark{Conclusion}
	\markboth{Conclusion}{Conclusion}
	\setcounter{chapter}{4}
	\setcounter{section}{0}
	
Here's a conclusion, demonstrating the use of all that manual incrementing and table of contents adding that has to happen if you use the starred form of the chapter command. The deal is, the chapter command in \LaTeX\ does a lot of things: it increments the chapter counter, it resets the section counter to zero, it puts the name of the chapter into the table of contents and the running headers, and probably some other stuff. 

So, if you remove all that stuff because you don't like it to say ``Chapter 4: Conclusion'', then you have to manually add all the things \LaTeX\ would normally do for you. Maybe someday we'll write a new chapter macro that doesn't add ``Chapter X'' to the beginning of every chapter title.

\section{More info}
And here's some other random info: the first paragraph after a chapter title or section head \emph{shouldn't be} indented, because indents are to tell the reader that you're starting a new paragraph. Since that's obvious after a chapter or section title, proper typesetting doesn't add an indent there. 


%If you feel it necessary to include an appendix, it goes here.
    \appendix
      \chapter{The First Appendix}
      \chapter{The Second Appendix, for Fun}


%This is where endnotes are supposed to go, if you have them.
%I have no idea how endnotes work with LaTeX.

  \backmatter % backmatter makes the index and bibliography appear properly in the t.o.c...

% if you're using bibtex, the next line forces every entry in the bibtex file to be included
% in your bibliography, regardless of whether or not you've cited it in the thesis.
    \nocite{*}

% Rename my bibliography to be called "Works Cited" and not "References" or ``Bibliography''
% \renewcommand{\bibname}{Works Cited}

%    \bibliographystyle{bsts/mla-good} % there are a variety of styles available; 
%  \bibliographystyle{plainnat}
% replace ``plainnat'' with the style of choice. You can refer to files in the bsts or APA 
% subfolder, e.g. 
 \bibliographystyle{APA/apa-good}  % or
 \bibliography{thesis}
 % Comment the above two lines and uncomment the next line to use biblatex-chicago.
 %\printbibliography[heading=bibintoc]

% Finally, an index would go here... but it is also optional.
\end{document}
