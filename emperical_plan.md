# Plan for Building the Empirical Testing Environment in a Low-Level Language

## 1. Overview
The empirical testing environment is the core of your thesis. It will provide:
1. **Consistent Benchmarking**: A standardized way to run multiple algorithms with uniform input and output handling.  
2. **Performance Metrics**: Tools to measure execution time, memory usage, accuracy (where applicable), and other relevant metrics such as fairness in hierarchical clustering.  
3. **Reproducibility & Extensibility**: Clear instructions and modular design so new algorithms or datasets can be added easily.

## 2. Choice of Language & Tools
- **Language Options**: C++ or Rust are strong candidates for low-level performance and control.  
  - **C++**: Has extensive libraries (e.g., for parallelism, graph data structures), a large user community, and mature build systems like CMake.  
  - **Rust**: Memory safety, a strong package ecosystem (Cargo), and good concurrency support. Might have fewer specialized libraries.  
- **Build System**: 
  - **CMake** (for C++) or **Cargo** (for Rust) can handle dependencies, versioning, and cross-platform builds.
- **Repository & Version Control**:
  - Use **GitHub** or **GitLab** for code hosting.  
  - Establish a clear branching strategy (e.g., `main` branch for stable code and `dev` branch for active development).

## 3. Architecture & Components
1. **Core Data Structures**  
   - A flexible graph or clustering structure to represent input data, possibly using adjacency lists or an edge list format (in the case of graph algorithms).  
   - Support for reading from multiple file formats (CSV, adjacency lists, custom formats).

2. **Algorithm Module**  
   - Each algorithm (e.g., a fair hierarchical clustering algorithm, a parallel cut algorithm) can be encapsulated in its own class or namespace.  
   - Common interface methods: 
     - `initialize()`: Read/prepare data.  
     - `run()`: Execute the core logic.  
     - `outputResults()`: Return or log relevant performance metrics and results.

3. **Benchmarking & Metrics**  
   - A central benchmarking driver that:  
     1. Loads the dataset or generates synthetic data.  
     2. Invokes the selected algorithm(s) with specified parameters.  
     3. Records metrics such as:
        - **Run time** (CPU/GPU time, wall-clock time).  
        - **Memory usage** (peak memory).  
        - **Algorithm-specific metrics** (e.g., fairness scores, cluster quality measures, approximation ratios).  
     4. Writes the results to a CSV or JSON for easier post-processing.

4. **Configuration & Logging**  
   - Use a configuration file (e.g., `config.json`) or command-line arguments to specify:
     - Algorithms to run.  
     - Dataset paths.  
     - Parameter variations (e.g., number of threads, tree depth, sample sizes).  
   - Implement a logging system (e.g., spdlog for C++ or env_logger for Rust) to capture runtime events, errors, and debug output.

5. **Parallel / Distributed Support**  
   - If evaluating parallel algorithms, incorporate appropriate libraries or frameworks:  
     - **C++**: Threads (C++11 `<thread>`), OpenMP, or MPI (for distributed memory systems).  
     - **Rust**: Native threads or crates like `rayon` for data parallelism.

6. **Testing & Validation**  
   - Set up automated tests (using **Google Test** for C++ or **cargo test** for Rust) to ensure basic functionality remains correct as you expand.  
   - Include small, well-known reference problems to verify that algorithms produce expected results (e.g., for a known graph or clustering dataset).

## 4. Milestones & Iterative Development
1. **Initial Prototype (Week 1–2)**  
   - Choose language and set up the basic project structure (CMake or Cargo).  
   - Implement a simple algorithm (e.g., a baseline clustering algorithm) to test the framework.  
   - Demonstrate reading inputs, running an algorithm, logging results.

2. **Intermediate Stage (Week 3–6)**  
   - Add additional algorithms—starting with simpler reference algorithms, then moving to more complex fair clustering or parallel methods.  
   - Create scripts to automate running multiple trials with different parameter settings.

3. **Scaling Up (Week 7–10)**  
   - Incorporate large synthetic data generation and real-world datasets.  
   - Evaluate how the system handles multi-threaded or distributed scenarios.  
   - Implement deeper performance logging (profiling, memory usage).

4. **Finalization (Week 11–15)**  
   - Complete documentation of the framework (how to add new algorithms, how to run benchmarks).  
   - Polish results storage format for easy plotting (CSV, JSON).  
   - Perform thorough testing and generate final performance comparisons.

## 5. Documentation & Usage
- **README**: Include clear instructions for setting up the environment (installing dependencies, building, running tests).  
- **Example Scripts**: Provide shell or Python scripts to demonstrate:
  1. How to compile the project.  
  2. How to run a suite of benchmarks.  
  3. How to interpret or visualize the results.

## 6. Next Steps
- Finalize your choice between C++ and Rust based on your comfort level and Harper’s feedback.  
- Set up the initial repository with a minimal working example so you can quickly iterate during your next meeting.  
- Keep track of challenges or additional library needs as you go, and communicate them to Harper in your progress updates.
